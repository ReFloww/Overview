# Tracking Earnings

Understanding and tracking your earnings is crucial for measuring investment success. This guide explains how returns work and how to monitor them.

## Types of Earnings

### Interest Payments

Regular earnings from loan repayments:
- Based on stated APY
- Distributed on schedule
- Primary source of returns

### Principal Repayments

Return of original investment:
- Typically at maturity
- May be in installments
- Full amount unless default

### Trading Gains/Losses

From secondary market activity:
- Sell above purchase price = gain
- Sell below purchase price = loss
- Affects total returns

## How Interest Accrues

### Accrual Method

Interest accrues daily based on:
```
Daily Accrual = (Principal × APY) / 365
```

### Example

```
Investment: 10,000 USDT
APY: 12%
Daily Accrual: (10,000 × 0.12) / 365 = 3.29 USDT/day
Monthly Accrual: 3.29 × 30 = 98.63 USDT
```

### Accrued vs. Distributed

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Accrued** | Earned but not yet paid |
| **Distributed** | Paid to your wallet |
| **Projected** | Expected future earnings |

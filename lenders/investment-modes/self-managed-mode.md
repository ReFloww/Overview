## How Self-Managed Mode Works

```

### The Process

1. **Browse Marketplace**: View all available loan products
2. **Analyze Loans**: Review details, rates, and risks
3. **Make Decisions**: Choose loans that fit your criteria
4. **Invest Directly**: Purchase loan tokens
5. **Manage Portfolio**: Track, rebalance, trade as needed
6. **Receive Returns**: Get repayments directly

## The Loan Marketplace

### Finding Loans

Navigate to the **Market** section to browse available loans.

### Loan Information

Each listing shows:

| Field | What It Tells You |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Loan Amount** | Total funding needed |
| **Available** | Amount still open for investment |
| **Interest Rate** | Annual yield (APY) |
| **Duration** | Loan term |
| **Risk Grade** | Credit assessment (A-E) |
| **Sector** | Industry category |

### Filtering and Sorting

Use filters to find suitable loans:

- **By Rate**: Minimum/maximum APY
- **By Grade**: Risk level preference
- **By Duration**: Short/medium/long term
- **By Sector**: Industry preference
- **By Amount**: Investment size

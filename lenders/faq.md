## Getting Started

### What is ReFlow?

ReFlow is a decentralized P2P lending platform that tokenizes loans from Restock.id, allowing you to invest in and trade loan positions using blockchain technology.

### How do I start lending?

1. Connect your Web3 wallet
2. Complete KYC verification
3. Fund your wallet with USDT and MNT
4. Choose managed or self-managed mode
5. Start investing

### What wallet do I need?

Any WalletConnect-compatible wallet works. Popular options include MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, and Trust Wallet.

### Why do I need KYC?

KYC (Know Your Customer) is required for regulatory compliance. Our partner Restock.id is OJK-licensed, requiring verified users.

### How long does KYC take?

Typically 24-48 hours. Ensure your documents are clear and information is accurate for faster processing.

## Investing

### What is the minimum investment?

Minimums vary by loan product. Check individual loan listings for specific requirements.

### What returns can I expect?

Returns vary by loan grade:
- Grade A: 8-10% APY
- Grade B: 10-12% APY
- Grade C: 12-15% APY
- Grade D+: 15%+ APY

Higher grades mean lower risk but lower returns.

### How is interest calculated?

Interest accrues daily based on the loan's APY. Your share is proportional to your token holdings.

### When do I receive payments?

Depends on the loan terms—monthly, quarterly, or at maturity. Check specific loan details for payment schedules.

### What currencies are supported?

Investments are made in USDT. You'll need MNT for gas fees on Mantle Network.

## Investment Modes

### What's the difference between managed and self-managed?

- **Managed Mode**: Professional fund managers invest on your behalf
- **Self-Managed Mode**: You choose individual loans yourself

### Which mode is better for beginners?

Managed mode is typically easier for beginners—no research needed and automatic diversification.

### Can I use both modes?

Yes! Many investors split their capital between managed and self-managed modes.

### How do I choose a fund manager?

Review their track record, strategy, fee structure, and current portfolio composition before investing.

## Secondary Market

### Can I sell my tokens before maturity?

Yes, that's the purpose of the secondary market. You can list tokens for sale anytime.

### How do I price my tokens?

Fair value is typically principal + accrued interest. Price higher for premium or lower for quick sale.

### How long does it take to sell?

Depends on your pricing and market conditions. Competitive pricing usually sells faster.

### Are there fees for trading?

Yes, sellers pay approximately 1% platform fee. Both parties pay their own gas fees.

### What if nobody buys my tokens?

You can adjust your price, wait longer, or cancel the listing and hold to maturity.

## Returns and Payments

### How do I track my earnings?

Go to Portfolio → Dashboard to see total returns, accrued interest, and payment history.

### What happens when a loan matures?

Principal plus final interest is distributed to token holders automatically.

### Are returns guaranteed?

No. Returns depend on borrower repayment. Defaults can result in partial or total loss.

### How is profit distributed?

Smart contracts automatically distribute repayments proportionally to all token holders.

## Risks and Safety

### What happens if a borrower defaults?

Restock.id manages collection efforts. Collateral may be liquidated for partial recovery. Losses are proportionally distributed.

### Is my money safe?

ReFlow uses non-custodial wallets—you control your assets. However, investment in loans carries credit risk.

### Are smart contracts audited?

Security audits are conducted. See [Audit Reports](../contracts/audits.md) for details.

### What are the main risks?

- Credit/default risk
- Liquidity risk
- Smart contract risk
- Market risk

See [Risks and Considerations](risks.md) for full details.

# Secondary Market

The Secondary Market is where loan tokens can be bought and sold before maturity. This is what makes ReFlow different from traditional P2P lending—you're never locked in.

## Why Secondary Market Matters

### Traditional P2P
- Money locked until maturity
- No early exit option
- Wait 6-12 months

### ReFlow Secondary Market
- Trade anytime
- Exit when needed
- Instant liquidity

## How It Works

```
Seller Lists Token → Buyer Purchases → Instant Transfer → Settlement Complete
```

### The Process

1. **Seller** lists loan tokens at desired price
2. **Buyer** finds suitable tokens
3. **Transaction** executes on-chain
4. **Tokens** transfer to buyer
5. **Funds** go to seller

## Market Mechanics

### Pricing

Tokens are priced based on:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Remaining Principal** | Base value |
| **Accrued Interest** | Added value |
| **Time to Maturity** | Affects attractiveness |
| **Risk Grade** | Premium or discount |
| **Market Demand** | Supply/demand dynamics |

### Fair Value Estimation

```
Estimated Value = Principal + Accrued Interest - Risk Discount
```

### Premium and Discount

| Scenario | Pricing |
|----------|---------|
| **High demand loan** | May trade at premium |
| **Urgent seller** | May sell at discount |
| **Default concerns** | Trades at discount |
| **Strong performance** | May trade at premium |

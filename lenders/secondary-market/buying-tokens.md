## Finding Opportunities

### Accessing Secondary Market

1. Navigate to **Market** → **Secondary**
2. View available listings
3. Use filters to narrow search

### Filters Available

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|

## Evaluating Listings

### Key Information

Each listing displays:

| Field | What to Check |
|-------|---------------|
| **Price** | Is it fair value? |
| **Original Principal** | Base investment |
| **Accrued Interest** | Already earned interest |
| **APY** | Return rate |
| **Days Remaining** | Time to maturity |
| **Risk Grade** | Credit quality |
| **Loan Status** | Performance health |

### Calculating Value

```
Fair Value = Principal + Accrued Interest
Your Cost = Listed Price + Gas
Your Return = (Maturity Value - Your Cost) / Your Cost
```

### Example Analysis

```
Listing:
- Price: 950 USDT
- Principal Remaining: 900 USDT
- Accrued Interest: 60 USDT
- APY: 12%
- Days Remaining: 30

Analysis:
- Fair Value: 900 + 60 = 960 USDT
- Discount: 10 USDT (1%)
- Value at Maturity: ~969 USDT
- Your Return: (969 - 950) / 950 = 2% in 30 days
```

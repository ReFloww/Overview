# Selling Loan Tokens

Need liquidity before your loan matures? The secondary market lets you exit positions anytime by selling your loan tokens.

## Why Sell on Secondary Market

### Common Reasons

| Reason | Situation |
|--------|-----------|
| **Emergency Cash** | Unexpected expense |
| **Rebalancing** | Adjusting portfolio |
| **Risk Reduction** | Concerns about loan |
| **Better Opportunities** | Found higher yields |
| **Taking Profits** | Lock in gains |

## Selling Process

### Step 1: Access Your Holdings

1. Go to **Portfolio**
2. Select the loan tokens to sell
3. Click **"Sell"** or **"List for Sale"**

### Step 2: Set Your Price

Consider:
- Current fair value (principal + accrued interest)
- Market conditions
- How quickly you need to sell
- Comparable listings

### Step 3: Create Listing

1. Enter asking price
2. Enter quantity to sell (all or partial)
3. Review listing details
4. Confirm and sign transaction

### Step 4: Wait for Buyer

Your listing is now live:
- Visible in secondary market
- Buyers can purchase anytime
- You retain ownership until sold

### Step 5: Sale Completes

When a buyer purchases:
- Tokens transfer automatically
- USDT arrives in your wallet
- Listing removed from market
- Transaction recorded

## Pricing Strategy

### Calculating Fair Value

```
Fair Value = Remaining Principal + Accrued Interest

Example:
Principal: 1,000 USDT
Accrued Interest: 50 USDT
Fair Value: 1,050 USDT
```

### Pricing Options

| Strategy | Price vs. Fair Value | Sale Speed |
|----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Quick Sale** | 95-98% | Fast |
| **Fair Price** | 100% | Moderate |
| **Premium** | 101-103% | Slow |

### Factors Affecting Price

**Higher Price Possible When:**
- Loan has excellent performance
- High APY compared to market
- Short time to maturity
- Strong borrower sector

**Lower Price Expected When:**
- Loan has missed payments
- Long remaining duration
- Low demand for grade/sector
- You need quick sale

## Listing Management

### Viewing Your Listings

1. Go to **Portfolio** → **Listings**
2. See all active sell orders
3. Track views and interest

### Modifying Price

1. Cancel existing listing
2. Create new listing at new price
3. Note: May need waiting period

### Canceling Listing

1. Select listing
2. Click **"Cancel"**
3. Confirm cancellation
4. Tokens return to regular holdings

## Partial Sales

### Selling Part of Position

You can sell a portion of your tokens:

1. Select token to sell
2. Enter quantity (less than total)
3. Set price per token or total
4. Remaining tokens stay in portfolio

### Example

```
You own: 1,000 tokens
Selling: 500 tokens
Price: 510 USDT
Keeping: 500 tokens
```

## Fees and Costs

### Selling Fees

| Fee Type | Amount | When Paid |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Platform Fee** | ~1% | Deducted from proceeds |
| **Gas Fee** | Variable | When listing/canceling |

### Net Proceeds Calculation

```
Gross Sale Price:     1,050 USDT
Platform Fee (1%):      -10.50 USDT
Gas Fee:                 -0.50 USDT
Net Proceeds:         1,039 USDT
```

## After the Sale

### What Happens

1. Buyer receives your tokens
2. You receive USDT (minus fees)
3. Position removed from portfolio
4. New owner gets future repayments

### Tax Considerations

You may have:
- **Gain**: If sale price > purchase price + accrued
- **Loss**: If sale price < purchase price + accrued

Keep records for tax reporting.

## Strategies for Selling

### Time-Based Selling

| Maturity | Strategy |
|----------|----------|
| **Near maturity** | Easier to sell at fair value |
| **Mid-term** | Price based on performance |
| **Long-term** | May need discount to attract buyers |

### Market-Aware Selling

**Seller's Market** (more buyers than sellers):
- Can price at premium
- Sells quickly
- Less negotiation

**Buyer's Market** (more sellers than buyers):
- May need discount
- Takes longer
- Consider waiting

### Portfolio-Based Selling

Sell when:
- Overweight in one sector
- Risk grade no longer fits goals
- Better opportunities available
- Need to rebalance

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Panic Selling

Don't sell at deep discount due to short-term concerns. Evaluate rationally.

### 2. Overpricing

Unrealistic prices mean no sale. Check comparable listings.

### 3. Ignoring Fees

Remember platform and gas fees when calculating proceeds.

### 4. Forgetting Tax Impact

Sales trigger taxable events. Plan accordingly.

## Tips for Successful Selling

1. **Price Competitively**: Check other listings first
2. **Be Patient**: Fair pricing may take time
3. **Time It Right**: Consider market conditions
4. **Document Everything**: Keep records of costs/proceeds
5. **Know Your Floor**: Set minimum acceptable price

## When Not to Sell

Consider holding instead if:
- Close to maturity (might as well wait)
- Only selling due to fear
- Loss would be significant
- No better use for funds

# Why Mantle Network?

ReFlow is built on Mantle Network, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution. Here's why we chose Mantle.

## What is Mantle Network?

Mantle is an Ethereum L2 blockchain that provides:
- **Scalability**: Higher throughput than Ethereum mainnet
- **Lower Costs**: Significantly reduced gas fees
- **Security**: Inherits Ethereum's security guarantees
- **Compatibility**: Full EVM compatibility

## Key Benefits

### 1. Low Transaction Costs

| Network | Typical Transfer Cost |
|---------|----------------------|
| Ethereum L1 | $5-50+ |
| Mantle L2 | $0.01-0.10 |

For a platform like ReFlow with frequent investments and distributions, low gas costs are essential.

### 2. Fast Finality

| Metric | Mantle |
|--------|--------|
| Block Time | ~2 seconds |
| Finality | Near-instant |

Fast confirmations mean better user experience.

### 3. EVM Compatibility

- Use existing Ethereum tools
- Deploy standard Solidity contracts
- Compatible with popular wallets
- Familiar developer experience

### 4. Ethereum Security

Mantle benefits from Ethereum's security:
- Fraud proofs
- Data availability
- Decentralized validators

### 5. Growing Ecosystem

- Active developer community
- Expanding DeFi ecosystem
- Regular network improvements
- Strong foundation support

## Technical Advantages

### For Users

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **Low Fees** | More of your investment works for you |
| **Fast Txs** | Instant feedback on actions |
| **Wallet Support** | Use MetaMask and other popular wallets |
| **Familiar UX** | Same as other EVM chains |

### For Developers

| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **EVM Compatible** | Use existing Solidity knowledge |
| **Standard Tools** | Hardhat, Foundry, Viem work natively |
| **Easy Deployment** | Same process as Ethereum |
| **Rich Libraries** | OpenZeppelin, etc. all compatible |

## Comparison

| Feature | Ethereum L1 | Mantle L2 |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Gas Costs | High | Very Low |
| Speed | ~15 sec blocks | ~2 sec blocks |
| Security | Native | Inherited |
| Tooling | Full | Full |
| Decentralization | High | Growing |

## Why Not Other L2s?

We evaluated multiple options:

| Network | Consideration |
|---------|---------------|
| **Polygon** | Good option, but Mantle offers lower fees |
| **Arbitrum** | Excellent, Mantle comparable with better grant support |
| **Optimism** | Similar to Arbitrum |
| **Mantle** | Best combination of low cost, support, and ecosystem |

## Network Stats

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| TPS | 500+ |
| Block Time | ~2 seconds |
| Native Token | MNT |
| EVM Version | Shanghai |

## Future-Ready

Mantle continues to evolve:
- Regular upgrades
- Improved decentralization
- Enhanced features
- Growing ecosystem

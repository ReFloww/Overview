**Conservative Split**
```
70% Managed Mode (stable returns)
30% Self-Managed (learning + alpha)
```

**Balanced Split**
```
50% Managed Mode
50% Self-Managed
```

**Aggressive Split**
```
30% Managed Mode (core portfolio)
70% Self-Managed (active management)
```

### Benefits of Hybrid

- Best of both worlds
- Compare performance directly
- Learn while earning
- Flexibility to adjust

## Starting Recommendations

### If New to ReFlow

1. **Month 1-3**: Start with Managed Mode only
   - Learn the platform
   - Observe how funds work
   - Understand the ecosystem

2. **Month 4-6**: Add small Self-Managed allocation
   - Try 10-20% self-managed
   - Make first independent investments
   - Compare your picks to manager

3. **Month 7+**: Optimize your mix
   - Analyze performance
   - Adjust allocation
   - Find your ideal balance

### If Experienced Investor

1. Start with your preferred approach
2. Consider small allocation to test other mode
3. Optimize based on results

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Choosing Based on Recent Performance

Don't pick managed mode just because a manager had great recent returns. Look at longer-term track records.

### Mistake 2: Underestimating Time Requirements

Self-managed mode takes real time. Be honest about your availability.

### Mistake 3: Over-diversifying Between Managers

If using managed mode, 1-3 managers is enough. Too many reduces benefit.

### Mistake 4: Changing Modes Too Frequently

Give your chosen approach time to work. Don't switch every month.

## Switching Modes

### From Managed to Self-Managed

1. Withdraw from fund (follow withdrawal process)
2. Wait for funds to settle
3. Begin self-managed investments
4. Transfer knowledge gained from observing

### From Self-Managed to Managed

1. Sell or hold existing positions
2. Select fund manager
3. Transfer funds
4. Combine remaining self-managed if desired

## Final Thoughts

### There's No Wrong Answer

Both modes can be profitable. The best mode is the one you'll stick with.

### Reassess Periodically

Your situation changes. Revisit this decision annually.

### Trust Your Judgment

You know your schedule, risk tolerance, and goals best.

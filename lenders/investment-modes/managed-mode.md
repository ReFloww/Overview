# Managed Mode (Auto-Invest)

Managed Mode lets professional fund managers handle your P2P lending investments. This guide explains how it works and how to get started.

## How Managed Mode Works

```
Your Investment → Fund Manager → Diversified Loan Portfolio → Returns to You
```

### The Process

1. **Choose a Fund Manager**: Browse and select based on track record
2. **Invest Capital**: Transfer USDT to the fund
3. **Manager Invests**: Professional allocation across loans
4. **Earn Returns**: Receive your share of loan repayments
5. **Withdraw Anytime**: Exit when you need to (conditions apply)

## Fund Managers

### What Fund Managers Do

- Analyze loan opportunities
- Select high-quality loans
- Diversify across sectors and risk grades
- Monitor loan performance
- Manage defaults and collections

### Manager Profiles

Each manager profile shows:

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Track Record** | Historical returns (APY) |
| **AUM** | Assets under management |
| **Strategy** | Investment approach |
| **Risk Level** | Conservative to aggressive |
| **Fee Structure** | Management fees |
| **Loan Mix** | Sector and grade distribution |

### Evaluating Managers

Consider these factors:

**Performance**
- Historical returns (longer is better)
- Consistency of returns
- Performance during defaults

**Strategy**
- Risk appetite alignment
- Diversification approach
- Sector preferences

**Transparency**
- Regular updates
- Clear communication
- Detailed reporting

## Fee Structure

### How Fees Work

| Fee Type | Rate | When Charged |
|----------|------|--------------|
| Platform Fee | ~1% | On returns |
| Management Fee | 1-2% | Annually on AUM |
| Performance Fee | 10-20% | On profits above benchmark |

### Example Calculation

```
Investment: 10,000 USDT
Gross Return: 12% (1,200 USDT)
Management Fee: 2% of 10,000 = 200 USDT
Platform Fee: 1% of 1,200 = 12 USDT
Performance Fee: 10% of 1,200 = 120 USDT
Net Return: 1,200 - 200 - 12 - 120 = 868 USDT (8.68%)
```

*Actual fees vary by manager. Check specific terms.*

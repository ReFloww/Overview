# What is ReFlow?

ReFlow is a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform that brings liquidity and transparency to real-world asset investments through blockchain technology.

## The Core Concept

Traditional P2P lending locks your money for months until loans mature. ReFlow changes this by converting loans into digital tokens that you can trade anytime, giving you control over your investments.

## How It Works (Simply Put)

1. **Restock.id originates loans** to verified borrowers in Indonesia
2. **ReFlow tokenizes these loans** into tradeable digital assets
3. **You invest** in loan tokens through the platform
4. **Earn returns** as borrowers repay their loans
5. **Trade anytime** on the secondary market if you need liquidity

## Key Features

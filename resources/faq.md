# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about ReFlow.

## General

### What is ReFlow?

ReFlow is a blockchain-based platform that brings liquidity to P2P lending by tokenizing loans as tradeable digital assets. Built on Mantle Network in partnership with Restock.id, it enables investors to trade loan positions on a secondary market.

### How is ReFlow different from traditional P2P lending?

Traditional P2P lending locks your investment until the loan matures. ReFlow tokenizes your investment as an ERC-20 token, allowing you to sell it on the secondary market at any time.

### Is ReFlow safe?

ReFlow uses non-custodial smart contracts audited for security. However, all investments carry risk. Loans are backed by Restock.id's underwriting process, but defaults can occur. Only invest what you can afford to lose.

### What blockchain does ReFlow use?

ReFlow is built on Mantle Network, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution that offers fast transactions and low fees while maintaining Ethereum's security.

## Getting Started

### How do I create an account?

1. Visit the ReFlow platform
2. Connect your Web3 wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. Complete KYC verification through our partner
4. Start investing

### What wallet do I need?

Any Ethereum-compatible wallet works with ReFlow. Popular options include MetaMask, Rainbow, Coinbase Wallet, and WalletConnect-compatible wallets.

### What is USDT and why do I need it?

USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. ReFlow uses USDT for all investments to protect against cryptocurrency volatility. You'll need USDT on Mantle Network to invest.

### How do I get USDT on Mantle Network?

You can bridge USDT from Ethereum mainnet using the official Mantle Bridge, or purchase on exchanges that support Mantle Network withdrawals.

## Investing

### What is the minimum investment?

The minimum investment varies by loan, typically starting at 100 USDT. Each loan displays its minimum investment amount.

### How do I choose loans to invest in?

In Self-Managed Mode, you can browse all available loans and review their details including interest rate, tenor, and risk grade. In Managed Mode, fund managers select loans based on their strategy.

### What returns can I expect?

Returns depend on the loans you invest in. Interest rates typically range from 10-18% annually, depending on loan risk grade and tenor. Actual returns may vary based on repayments and any defaults.

### When do I receive repayments?

Repayments follow the loan schedule, typically monthly. When borrowers repay, funds are distributed proportionally to all token holders and appear in your portfolio.

### What happens if a loan defaults?

If a borrower fails to repay, Restock.id initiates collection procedures. Recovery rates vary. Token prices on the secondary market may decrease for defaulted loans.

## Secondary Market

### How do I sell my investment?

1. Go to your Portfolio
2. Select the loan token to sell
3. Click "List for Sale"
4. Set your price
5. Confirm the transaction

### How is the price determined?

Sellers set their own asking prices. Market prices reflect supply and demand. You can sell at a premium, discount, or face value depending on market conditions.

### Are there fees for trading?

Yes, there's a small platform fee (typically 0.5-1%) on secondary market transactions. Gas fees also apply for blockchain transactions.

### Can I buy existing loan positions?

Yes, you can browse the secondary market and purchase loan tokens from other investors. This allows you to invest in loans that may already be partially repaid.

## Managed vs Self-Managed

### What's the difference between modes?

**Self-Managed Mode**: You choose which loans to invest in, maintaining full control over your investment decisions.

**Managed Mode**: Professional fund managers select loans based on their strategy. You benefit from their expertise in exchange for a management fee.

### Which mode is right for me?

- Choose **Self-Managed** if you want full control and are comfortable analyzing loans
- Choose **Managed** if you prefer professional management and a more hands-off approach

### Can I use both modes?

Yes, you can have investments in both modes simultaneously with different portions of your capital.

## Technical

### What are gas fees?

Gas fees are small payments to process transactions on the blockchain. Mantle Network has very low gas fees, typically under $0.01 per transaction.

### What if my transaction fails?

Blockchain transactions can fail due to network issues or insufficient gas. If a transaction fails, your funds remain in your wallet. Try again with slightly higher gas settings.

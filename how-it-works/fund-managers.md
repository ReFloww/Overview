# Fund Managers

Fund managers are professional investors who manage capital on behalf of lenders in ReFlow's Managed Mode. This guide explains how they work.

## What Are Fund Managers?

Fund managers are approved professionals or entities who:
- Invest pooled capital across multiple loans
- Make investment decisions on behalf of investors
- Provide diversification and expertise
- Charge fees for their services

## How Fund Managers Work

### The Structure

```
Multiple Lenders → Fund Pool → Manager Invests → Returns Distributed
       ↓              ↓              ↓                  ↓
   You invest    Capital pooled   Loan selection    You receive share
```

### The Process

1. **You invest** in a fund manager's pool
2. **Manager receives** pooled capital
3. **Manager selects** loans based on their strategy
4. **Manager allocates** across multiple positions
5. **Loans generate returns**
6. **Returns distributed** to all pool participants
7. **Fees deducted** for manager

## Types of Fund Managers

### By Strategy

| Type | Focus | Risk Level |
|------|-------|------------|
| **Conservative** | Grade A/B loans | Lower |
| **Balanced** | Mix of grades | Medium |
| **Growth** | Higher yield focus | Higher |
| **Sector-Specific** | Agriculture, SME, etc. | Varies |

### By Size

| Size | AUM | Characteristics |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| **Small** | < $100K | Newer, growing |
| **Medium** | $100K-$1M | Established |
| **Large** | > $1M | Proven track record |

## Evaluating Fund Managers

### Key Metrics

| Metric | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Track Record** | Consistent returns over time |
| **AUM** | Assets under management |
| **APY** | Historical annual returns |
| **Drawdown** | Maximum loss experienced |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | Risk-adjusted returns |
| **Default Rate** | Loans that defaulted |

### Manager Profile

Each manager displays:

```

│   ├── Volatility
│   └── Benchmark comparison
├── Current Portfolio
│   ├── Number of loans

### Questions to Ask

1. **Performance**: Are returns consistent?
2. **Strategy**: Does it match your goals?
3. **Fees**: Are they reasonable?
4. **Transparency**: Do they communicate well?
5. **Diversification**: How spread out is the portfolio?

## Fee Structures

### Common Fee Types

| Fee | Description | Typical Range |
|-----|-------------|---------------|
| **Management Fee** | Annual fee on AUM | 1-2% |
| **Performance Fee** | Share of profits | 10-20% |
| **Entry Fee** | One-time on deposit | 0-1% |
| **Exit Fee** | On early withdrawal | 0-2% |

### Fee Calculation Example

```
Your Investment: 10,000 USDT
Gross Return: 15% = 1,500 USDT

Fees:
- Management Fee: 2% of 10,000 = 200 USDT
- Performance Fee: 15% of 1,500 = 225 USDT
- Total Fees: 425 USDT

Net Return: 1,500 - 425 = 1,075 USDT (10.75%)
```

# Creating Your Account

Your ReFlow account is linked to your blockchain wallet. This guide covers the account creation process in detail.

## Wallet-Based Authentication

Unlike traditional platforms, ReFlow uses wallet-based authentication:

- **No Username/Password**: Your wallet is your identity
- **Cryptographic Security**: Sign messages to prove ownership
- **Self-Sovereign**: You control your account completely

## Supported Wallets

ReFlow supports any WalletConnect-compatible wallet:

| Wallet | Platform | Recommended For |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| MetaMask | Browser/Mobile | Most users |
| Rainbow | Mobile | Mobile-first users |
| Coinbase Wallet | Browser/Mobile | Coinbase users |
| Trust Wallet | Mobile | Mobile users |
| Ledger | Hardware | High security |
| WalletConnect | Universal | Any compatible wallet |

## Step-by-Step Account Creation

### Step 1: Access ReFlow

1. Open your browser
2. Navigate to the ReFlow platform
3. Ensure you're on the official site (check URL carefully)

### Step 2: Connect Wallet

1. Click **"Connect Wallet"** button
2. A modal will appear with wallet options
3. Select your preferred wallet

### Step 3: Wallet Approval

In your wallet:

1. **Connection Request**: Approve connecting to ReFlow
2. **Network Switch**: Switch to Mantle Network if prompted
3. **Sign Message**: Sign the authentication message

*The signature proves you own the wallet without sharing private keys.*

### Step 4: Complete Profile

After connection, complete your profile:

```

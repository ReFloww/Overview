# Investment Modes

ReFlow offers two distinct ways to invest in P2P loans. Choose the approach that matches your investment style and goals.

## Overview

| Feature | Managed Mode | Self-Managed Mode |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Decision Making** | Fund manager | You |
| **Time Required** | Minimal | Active |
| **Diversification** | Automatic | Manual |
| **Control** | Limited | Full |
| **Best For** | Passive investors | Hands-on investors |

## Managed Mode (Auto-Invest)

In Managed Mode, professional fund managers handle your investments.

### How It Works
